Hey there whoever is reading this, thanks for stopping by! Below are some instructions on how to get the game to run on your machine/update :D.

the game is still very young and much of a work in progress, please feel free to mention any advice or bugs on the TOSTR discord in the testing channel.

# How to play the game?
> The latest stable build can be very different than the latest development build. However it is the most easy to download and run
### Step 1 (Downloading the build)
Simply download the latest stable build version [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1T1oH0zJLSnCoq9H7CCcmo5kqS38PWkl1) and unzip it wherever is the most convenient.

### Step 2 (Running the build)
Within the unzipped folder run "LearningRPG.exe" and enjoy the game :)


## How to get the latest development build?
> The latest development build is updated very regularly/can sometimes be unstable.
### Step 1 (Downloading the correct Unity)
Download and Install [Unity 2019.1.5](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) 

### Step 2 (Cloning the project onto your machine)
Head over to the [main branch]() and click the green "clone or download" button.
If you have not used github before then click the download as zip button and extract the folder somewhere where you will find it later.

### Step 3 (Opening the project in unity)
Open unity and select "open project".
In the new dialog, select the extracted folder made earlier as the project to open.

### Step 4 (Building the Project)
Now in unity, Head to "File" > "Build Settings".
In this page, make sure that all settings are correct for your machine (If you don't know what to do you can skip this).
Now press the "Build" button, In the File Explorer dialog which opens, create a folder named "Build" and select it.

### Step 5 (Running the game)
Open the Build folder created earlier and simply run the "LearningRPG.exe" executable. The game should boot up and start.


## Updating the game!
> Pull requests update your version of the game folder to the latest version updated by the devs! (it is sometimes possible that the latest update can contain game breaking bugs. If this is the case, it is wiser to download the latest STABLE build in the first section of this readme).
### Step 1 (Clone the project using Git Desktop)
Simply download [Git Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and use it to clone the repository using the repository clone link on the main page
### Step 2 (Pull request)
Link the folder to unity as seen before and use it as previously. In order to update simply press the Pull request button on Git Desktop.
